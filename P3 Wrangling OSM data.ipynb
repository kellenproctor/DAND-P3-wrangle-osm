I ran it for both ***node*** and ***way*** tags, and found some interesting results. The lists were very long, so I will go over the issues that stand out below. To evaluate specific tag values, I'm using the function `tag_search(filename, tag_name, regex)` in the audit.py file, with an example below. The `regex` value was changed for each tag attribute investigated.\n",

According to the OSM wiki entry, the GNIS is a database of \"names\" and not \"features\" and further, that many of these entries are incorrect or no longer exist. This poses a fantastic challenge to OSM, and would be a great opportunity for programmatically cleaning the OSM database, which I will discuss in review below. Using tag_search, it doesn't look like there is much of value in these tags, at least for this project. I am going to exclude these tags as well.\n",

Further investigation proves this to be correct, as TIGER stands for \"The Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing system (TIGER) data,[which is] produced by the US Census Bureau, is a public domain data source which has many geographic features. The TIGER/Line files are extracts of selected geographic information, including roads, boundaries, and hydrography features. All of the roads were imported into OSM in 2007 and 2008, populating the nearly empty map of the United States.\" from the [OSM wiki page][1].

    "### Additional Improvements\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mapping Contributions\n",
    "An interesting visualization would be a \"heat-map\" of contributions. Since nodes and ways have latitude and longitude attributes, we could generate a list of lat-lon pairs, and maps those as dots on a blank canvas. You could even run a query to count any similar coordinates, and adjust the size of the dots accordingly. I think this would be a fascinating way to see where most of the user activity is for the OSM file. Further, it would be interesting to see if the points themselves can generate a dot-map of the city. I don't know how to run the visualization yet, but I can build a query which pulls coordinates and counts\n",

    "```\n",
    "***PITCH?!*** is super British. Minus 10 points for Gryffindor. In America, we simply call them fields. I'm all for globalization and learning about new things, but if this data is to accurately reflect America, then the map lexicon should reflect that too. It's kind of like when you do a global view of [Google Maps][1], where international cities also include the name in the language as well (Asia chosen as an example, because of the diversity of language). Going along with this vein, it might be interesting to set up a sort of lexicon filter, to automate the nationalization, if you will, of the maps being cleaned. The difficulty in doing this is that the lexicon might be tremendously subject to the user's opinion on the matter. As an example, I think all pitches in America should be called fields, but that is certainly up for debate.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "This has been a really fun project. Diving through the data for LA really shows you the character of the city, especially because the customizability of OSM reflects the values of its users. Do you want to track horses on a property? You can do so. Do you want to know if a store is a drive through? By all means. There is so much to explore in this data, and scripting solutions for cleaning and auditing the data has been a blast.\n",
