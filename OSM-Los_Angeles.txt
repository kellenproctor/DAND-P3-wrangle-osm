Dear Coach,

I trust you are having a pleasant day! I also hope you only have to read this once, but in case you're reviewing my submission a second time, I can guarantee that nothing in this doc has changed.

I used the Raw OpenStreetMap dataset, OSM XML, for Los Angeles for this project, which clocked in at 455 MB compressed, and over 8 GB uncompressed. Because it was so massive (and playing along locally with the Chicago OSM dataset - 2 GB - for the courses crashed my computer), I ran the python script, which I named sample.py, provided in the Project Prep with a k of 1000, 500, and 250.

Note: This file was used to test early python data auditing and cleaning scripts.
